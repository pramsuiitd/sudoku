# sudoku_solver
This is my solution to the sudoku solver problem.
It does not uses any recursion and instead execute the program using loops.
You can use checking time to check the code and any of your codes against 50 inputs.
Just make sure to put the correct file names and keep them in the same directory.
Feel free to use it. Thanks!
